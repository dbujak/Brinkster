							<p>Yours when you manufacture your CD or DVD at Oasis: true control of your website.  
							Hosted by HostBaby (the same great folks as CD Baby), and paid for <strong>five months 
							free</strong> by your friends at Oasis when you manufacture a retail ready CD or DVD project.  
							(It's $20 a month after that, which we think you'll be happy to pay).</p>

<p>Here's a tour of one of the greatest things about this service: the HostBaby Wizard.</p>

<p>It's a free tool for any musicians who host their website at HostBaby.</p>

<p>The Wizard makes you a great professionally-designed music website in under an hour - and makes all 
future updates even easier.</p>

<p>ALL the things that a musician's website needs: streaming audio, concert calendar, photo gallery, mailing 
list, etc - are DONE already!</p>

<p>All you need to do is answer its questions, upload your music, choose a design, and you're done!</p>

<p>Watch as Derek Sivers, the legendary founder of HostBaby and CD Baby, shows you how it works.  
Please note that all trademarks belong to their respective owners, and click on the arrow to start; 
this tour only takes a minute...</p>
