										<P class="MsoNormal">Computers are everywhere! Not just the PCs we’re using for 
											e-mails and Internet. When we wake up and turn on coffee makers, TVs, 
											microwaves they all have computers inside. Our cars have computers so do 
											traffic lights, elevators…</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">However, we constantly get frustrated when dealing with 
											computers. That is because computers are very good at respective tasks, but 
											they cannot think.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">Software runs computers, it can make use of microprocessor and 
											memory and do some useful work - if designed effectively.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, there is a lot of badly written software out 
											there.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">For example, go to your ATM machine. First thing it will ask 
											you is what language you’d like, even thought you probably never picked 
											anything else other then English. It allows you to select amounts greater then 
											your balance, just to inform you right away that you don’t have that much on 
											your account. Gives you options of other checking and savings accounts even 
											thought you don’t have them... Nevertheless, we all use ATMs, instead of 
											tellers! They work 24 hours a day, we don’t need to fill out forms, wait in 
											lines, heck get out of our cars… Like the story of the dancing bear: it’s not 
											important that the bear is a horrible dancer, it’s amazing that the bear dances 
											at all. The same goes for the computers. Most of us get amazed that a computer 
											can do something we have never thought it could do, not that it does a terrible 
											job at doing it.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">There is a better way! Software can be designed and built to 
											make users’ experience enjoyable! It is done by not intimidating users. It is 
											done by setting up process in a natural and intuitive way.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">In the real world, house is first conceptualized by designers, 
											then engineered by architects and engineers, and finally built by construction 
											workers. In the software world, we are missing designers! Engineers don’t speak 
											the language of users or of the management, so the design needs to be redone 
											constantly by the programmers.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">Pioneered by Cooper, Goal-Directed® design is the solution. It 
											designs software for imaginary personas through scenarios. Everything is geared 
											toward the persona. After the user interface is done to the greatest detail (in 
											picture and word), it is handed to the architects and engineers to design 
											databases, components… and finally to the programmers who will turn those plans 
											to life, and do it right the first time. Some tweaks are possible but they are 
											minimal.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">We can do the proper design for you and your own engineers and 
											programmers can finish up the work, or if you need complete solution, we will 
											do it all for you.</P>
										<P class="MsoNormal">When it comes to Windows environment we specialize in .Net. We 
											can create for you:</P>
