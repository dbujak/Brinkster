						<h3>Moving Tips</h3>

						<P>
						Dear Prospective Seller,
						<p>
						Now that you have sold your house and found a new home to live in, it is time 
						to begin the transition. Moving can be a stressful time, but planning ahead 
						will help you from becoming overwhelmed. Below are some helpful hints to ease 
						you through the process.
						<p>
						First and foremost, it is essential to purchase the proper packing materials, 
						such as bubble wrap, boxes, peanuts, paper and tape – all of which can be 
						bought from moving or truck-rental companies. They often sell kits; for 
						example, a dish cell for protecting china and crystal, or wardrobe boxes that 
						allow you to keep clothes on hangers.
						<p>
						If you are hiring a professional moving company, it is a good idea to inquire 
						for estimates approximately 6-8 weeks prior to moving, if possible. This is 
						especially important if you are moving during the peak summer season between 
						May and September. There are two types of estimates offered; a binding 
						estimate, which guarantees the total cost of the move based on the quantities 
						and services shown on the statement, and a non-binding estimate, which is an 
						approximation of the cost and is subject to change. Once you have decided on a 
						company to use, call to schedule the date of the move. As your moving date 
						approaches, call to confirm the arrangement with the company.
						<p>
						It is important to plan ahead and start packing early. Choose a "packing room" 
						where you can store packed boxes and packing materials. Begin packing items 
						that you won’t need a few weeks before the move and box up a few items each 
						day. Because many things cannot be done until the last minute, it is essential 
						to do as much as possible before that time.
						<p>
						Pack one room at a time and be sure to label each box with its destination as 
						well as a description of its contents. This will make unpacking easier.
						<p>
						When packing a box, pour a layer of packing peanuts on the bottom for cushion. 
						Make sure to place the heaviest items on the bottom. Once the box has been 
						packed, use packing peanuts or crumpled packing paper to fill empty spaces and 
						prevent contents from shifting. Make certain after you pack a box that you can 
						still lift it easily. To reduce the chance of breakage, unpack fragile items 
						over the box that you are taking them out of, so if you accidentally drop it, 
						it will land on some cushion.
						<p>
						Remember that hazardous materials may not be shipped. These items include 
						paint, nail polish and remover as well as cleaning and laundry products. It is 
						best if you personally transport irreplaceable items, such as keepsake photos, 
						financial and legal documents, medical records, jewelry and other valuables. 
						Also, make certain that each family member has a bag packed with essential 
						items for the first few nights. These items should be carried with you rather 
						than packed in the moving truck. It might be a good idea to have some snacks as 
						well as a simple meal that you can just heat and serve for when you arrive in 
						your new home. Don’t forget to have sheets, bath towels and kitchen utensils 
						handy.
						<p>
						Once everything is packed, it is important to have a strategy to load the 
						truck. It is best to first load items that you need the least and make sure to 
						put the heaviest items on the bottom. House plants should be loaded last and 
						unloaded first.
						<p>
						Make arrangements for children and pets to spend moving day with a family 
						member or close friend. If you can, move on a weekday, when banks and utility 
						companies are open. Most moving companies only accept cash, certified check or 
						money order. All charges must be paid before your shipment is unloaded at your 
						new house.
						<p>
						To make the change-of-address process smoother, order preprinted address labels 
						with your new address as soon as you know it. Send out change of address 
						notices to family, friends, employers, schools, banks, credit cards, doctors’ 
						offices, utility companies, etc. Keep a checklist so that you know who you have 
						informed of your address change. Don’t forget to transfer services for your 
						utilities. If possible, make sure that power and water are functioning properly 
						at your new home before you arrive and leave them on at your old address for a 
						few days so you can do any necessary clean-up after the move.
