						Dear Prospective Seller,
						<p>
						I know that the idea of moving can seem daunting, but it is also the perfect 
						opportunity to get rid of the extra items that you have accumulated. Now is the 
						time to go through your house room by room and toss out any possessions that 
						you do not need. This will prevent you from spending time and money packing 
						things you will not want.
						<p>Develop criteria that will help you to weed out items that are not worth taking 
							with you to your new home. Here are some questions to consider:
							<ul>
								<li>
								Does it have sentimental value?
								<li>
								Who gave it to you?
								<li>
								Does it have monetary value?
								<li>
								Does anyone use it?
								<li>
								When is the last time it was used?
								<li>
								Will you use it again before you would want an updated version?
								<li>
								Is there room for it in our new home?
								<li>
									Will you miss it if it is gone?</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
						Take inventory of everything you decide to keep and assign replacement values 
						for insurance purposes. Plan to sell or donate anything that does not make the 
						cut. Make sure to properly dispose of any hazardous materials, such as cleaning 
						products and paint.
						<p>
						Pack away stuff that you know you will not use for a while. Since so many 
						things need to be done at the last minute, it is a good idea to pack as much as 
						possible before crunch times comes. Use up items that cannot be moved, such as 
						foods that are stored in your freezer.
						<p>Following these suggestions will keep you ahead of the game.
