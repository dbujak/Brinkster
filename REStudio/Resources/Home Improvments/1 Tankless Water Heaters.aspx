						<h3>Tankless Water Heaters</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 185 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>
						<P>
						Dear Home Owner,
						<p>
						Imagine never running out of hot water. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to take 
						a shower with an unlimited supply of hot water without the possibility of it 
						turning cold at any minute. Using a tankless water heater is the only way that 
						this can this be achieved. Also called “on demand” or “instantaneous” water 
						heaters, tankless water heaters only heat water when needed and thus do not 
						have a tank that runs out of water (as is the case with conventional water 
						heaters). Consumers across the country are realizing that tankless water 
						heaters not only provide continuous on-demand hot water, but also a substantial 
						cost and space savings.
						<p>
						Homeowners who like to relax by slipping into a warm luxurious bubble bath 
						often find themselves sitting in tepid water. Instead of slipping into a tub 
						for a hot soak, they sit shivering. In order to prevent this, one would have to 
						constantly checking the temperature to make sure the hot water supply doesn’t 
						run out before the tub is full.
						<p>
						The problem is that conventional hot water tanks often fail to have enough 
						hot-water capacity to fill 60- or 80-gallon bathtub. However, through the 
						wonders of modern technology, a solution to the problem finally exists. 
						Tankless water heaters are designed to provide an endless supply of hot water, 
						allowing homeowners to fill the tub to the brim at anytime. Unlike conventional 
						storage-tank water heaters, tankless versions heat water only as it is used. 
						When a hot water tap is opened, sensors in the heater kick-on to activate the 
						heating elements, which then allow the heater to deliver a constant supply of 
						hot water.
						<p>
						There are many benefits to owning a tankless water heater, including the amount 
						of energy that is saved. A conventional water heater uses up to 20 percent or 
						more of a household’s annual energy cost. It also loses from 10 to 20 percent 
						of the annual water heating cost because of the heated water just sitting in 
						the tank. This water is constantly being heated and therefore using energy for 
						water not in use. On the other hand, a tankless heater uses energy only to heat 
						the water when a faucet or appliance is turned on. When not in use, the water 
						heater is off. Many tankless water heaters will save a household anywhere from 
						25 to 45 percent in energy expenditures. Tankless water heaters save space with 
						no need for a bulky tank and can be installed virtually anywhere in the house. 
						Equipment life may be longer than tank-type heaters because they are less 
						subject to corrosion. The expected life of a tankless water heater is 20 years, 
						compared with 10 to 15 years for conventional water heaters.
						<p>
						Tankless water heaters have an electric, gas, or propane heating device that is 
						activated by the flow of water. Once activated, the heater provides a constant 
						supply of hot water. The maximum flow rate at a desired temperature will be 
						determined by the capacity of the heater. Gas tankless water heaters typically 
						have larger capacities than electric tankless water heaters. In most cases, 
						electric tankless water heaters will cost more to operate than gas tankless 
						water heaters. Though tankless water heaters can operate on electricity, 
						gas-powered heaters tend to deliver hot water at higher rates and are 
						recommended for houses with more than two bathrooms.
						<p>
						Tankless water heaters range in price from $200 for a small under-sink unit up 
						to $1200 for a gas-fired unit that delivers 5 gallons per minute. Typically, 
						the more hot water the unit produces, the more it will cost.
						<p>
						New construction is the ideal time to install a tankless water heater in order 
						to maximize the benefits and minimize costs. Heaters can be centrally located 
						in the house in order to minimize hot water runs. Additionally, electric wiring 
						and/or venting is installed easily during construction rather than being 
						retrofitted.
						<p>
						When transitioning from the use of conventional water heaters to tankless 
						systems in your existing home, it is recommended as with any major retrofit to 
						choose your contractor wisely. Make sure that they specialize in tankless water 
						heaters so you get a high quality installation from someone who understands 
						what has to be done.
						<p>
						Tankless water heaters have improved environmental performance over 
						conventional water heaters due to their decreased energy consumption. Other 
						environmental benefits reside in the decreased material use resulting in less 
						manufacturing, lower transportation and storage requirements, and less landfill 
						volume. The outlet temperature can be set lower than tank systems; the 
						potential for scalding accidents is reduced. Tankless hot water heaters save 
						energy and thus money. Using energy efficiently and conscientiously reduces 
						pollution, global warming, and waste. Better use of energy can mean saving 
						money.
						<p>
						Tankless systems are a win-win not only for your wallet but for the 
						environment.
