						Dear Home Owner and Gardening Enthusiast,
						<p>
						To begin planning your herb garden, the first thing to think about is location. 
						Full sun is the best for herbs. However, most herbs will grow in partial shade. 
						They may not grow as fast in partial shade, but they will do just fine. The 
						place you must avoid is full shade; herbs will not grow here. Herbs require 
						very little attention during growing season. Herbs develop best in moderately 
						damp, well drained soils. They need an area with good drainage and regular 
						watering. If you live in area where weekly rainfall is less than an inch 
						regular watering is a must. To help regulate ground moisture use about 3 inches 
						of some sort of mulch.
						<p>
						Once you have decided on a spot for your herb garden, you need to start 
						thinking about what herbs you would like to grow. Think about herbs that you 
						use on a regular basis. Do you reach for certain herbs over and over again when 
						cooking? Do you like to use mint in your desserts? Chives on your sour cream 
						and baked potato? Whatever reason you decide you are growing herbs for will 
						help you decide which herbs to grow. If it's for cooking, which herbs do you 
						currently use? Grow ones that you know you use and try some new ones to spice 
						up your cooking. You will also need to find out if the herbs you have chosen 
						will grow in your zone and soil type.
						<p>
						Now it is time to make a planting plan. First, make a list of all the herbs you 
						will be growing and give a little information about them such as spacing 
						requirements, height of plants, foliage color etc. To find these requirements, 
						look these plants up in a gardening reference book. Next, decide what shape of 
						bed you'd like and what size. An island bed is one that can be accessed from 
						all sides, should be no wider than 5 ft, and a border bed is one that can only 
						be accessed from the front should be no wider than 2 1/2 ft. As herbs are 
						functional plants that require easy access, herb gardens should always be 
						planned for easy harvest.
						<p>
						Sketch out your bed and begin to place your herbs according to height and which 
						herbs compliment each other. Mint a notorious creeper needs to be kept in check 
						by creating some sort of natural barrier. These are some of the things to thing 
						about when placing where to plant your herbs. Remember, to write down how far 
						apart the plants should be spaced. As you are placing your plants, make notes. 
						Use this sketch as your planting guide. Also, during the year make notes on how 
						your plants are doing so you can make adjustments for the next planting season.
						<p>
						Fresh herbs from your garden will liven up meals and are far more flavorful 
						than the dried variety found in grocery stores. You can harvest them fresh for 
						daily use during the spring and summer and also plan ahead and dry or freeze 
						them for later use. During the winter, you will have to protect them by adding 
						several inches of mulch to your herb garden to prevent their shallow roots from 
						coming up during the spring thaw. They can be taken indoors for the winter to 
						continue supplying the kitchen with flavor until the following spring by 
						transplanting cuttings into clay pots and placing them in a sunny kitchen 
						window sill and then returning them to the garden come spring. The biggest 
						problem with growing herbs in containers indoors is getting enough light. Try 
						finding a south facing window with maximum sun exposure. To prepare your 
						cuttings to winter indoors it is recommended in late fall to start bringing 
						them in a few hours a day so they can start adjusting to the temperature and 
						light. This way they won’t go into shock.
						<p>Some of the more common herbs include the following:
							<br>
							<b>Basil</b>: An annual that likes full sun and well drained soil. It is an 
							essential element of Italian cuisine or anywhere that tomatoes are used. The 
							richly fragrant leaves are excellent with a tomato and mozzarella salad. 12 in 
							high by 12 in wide.<br>
							<b>Chives</b>: A hardy perennial that easily re-seeds itself. The leaves have a 
							mild onion flavor. The plant has lovely purple flowers in summer. 12 in high by 
							6 inches wide.<br>
							<b>Cilantro</b>: This annual, yields leaves and seeds. 18 in high by 8 in wide.<br>
							<b>Dill</b>: A tall growing annual. The flowers have a mild flavor with 
							strongly flavored seeds. 5 ft high by 4 ft wide<br>
							<b>Lavender</b>: A semi hardy perennial. This low growing plant likes lots of 
							sun with a mild alkali soil. The flowers and seeds make great potpourris. 9 in 
							high by 9 in wide.<br>
							<b>Mint</b>: A perennial that can take over slower growing plants.<br>
							<b>Oregano</b>: A semi hardy perennial essential for Italian cuisine. It likes 
							a well drained alkali soil with full sun. 15 in high by 12 in wide.<br>
							<b>Rosemary</b>: A perennial that goes well with oregano and thyme. It requires 
							full sun and a well drained sandy soil. 3 ft high by 2 ft wide.<br>
							<b>Sage</b>: A perennial that grows well in partial shade. The leaves need to 
							be harvested before the plant flowers. 2 ft high by 3 ft wide.<br>
							<b>Tarragon</b>: A semi hardy perennial that needs well drained full sun soil. 
							Excellent with chicken. 3 ft high by 1 ft wide.<br>
							<b>Thyme</b>: A low growing perennial best harvested shortly after flowering. 
							Thyme likes well drained full sun soil. 6 in high by 18 in wide.<br>
						<p>
						Herb Gardens provide s lot of enjoyment and an opportunity for you to add a 
						dash of flavor and fragrance to your cooking. Seeing how the herbs mingle 
						together and enjoying their fragrance is another wonderful benefit pf planting 
						an herb garden. Whatever reason you choose for growing herbs, this is a form of 
						gardening that pays back in beauty, aroma, and, of course, "good taste". 
						Remember to have fun! Gardening is an ongoing process.
