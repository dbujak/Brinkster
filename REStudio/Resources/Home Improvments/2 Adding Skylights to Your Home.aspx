						<h3>Adding Skylights to Your Home</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time:&nbsp;90 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>

						Dear Home Owner,
						<p>
						When remodeling your home, don’t forget to think about lighting options. 
						Whether you are looking for an energy saving light source, something more 
						natural than fluorescent lights, or a room with a better view, skylights may be 
						the solution. Available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, skylights meet a 
						number of demands when thinking about how to increase light in your house.
						<p>
						Adding skylights is a relatively easy renovation project that can add a 
						dramatic element of light, beauty, and value to a home. Traditionally, 
						skylights have been most commonly used in kitchens and bathrooms. However, they 
						are now being incorporated throughout entire houses, including foyers, 
						bedrooms, walk-in closets, staircases, and anywhere someone wants to bring in 
						natural light and open up a space. Skylights allow up to 30 percent more 
						natural light to permeate a dark space without sacrificing privacy. With little 
						or no need for artificial light, skylights allow for less energy consumption 
						during both the winter and summer months. Skylights will decrease your overall 
						energy costs saving you money in the long run. So not only do they look 
						beautiful, they are functional too.
						<p>
						Modern installation methods have reduced risk of leakage and therefore made 
						skylights increasingly popular in the last decade. They are available in a 
						variety of shapes, sizes, and designs, so it is easy to find one that is right 
						for your home remodeling project. Skylights should cover a minimum of ten 
						percent of the total square footage of the room. You can cluster smaller 
						skylights together for maximum effect or just use one large skylight.
						<p>
						The most influential motivation behind this trend toward more light-filled, 
						open homes is most likely the psychological and physiological benefits. It 
						enhances moods, improves our health and can boost energy up to 24 percent, 
						according to scientific experts. A home with maximum day light is the perfect 
						retreat in this stress-filled world.
