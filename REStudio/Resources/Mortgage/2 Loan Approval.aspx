						<h3>Loan Approval</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 150 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>
						<P>
						Dear Prospective Buyer,
						<p>
						As you begin the process of buying a home, it is imperative that you understand 
						loan procedures and the factors that determine loan approval. This email gives 
						you an overview of what lenders are looking for when reviewing your credit 
						report.
						<p><b><u>What is your FICO?</u></b>
						<p>
						A FICO score is a credit score developed by Fair Isaac &amp; Company to help 
						lenders determine the risk involved in lending money to any person applying for 
						a loan. It is widely accepted by lenders as one of the most important 
						components helping determine eligibility as well as specific amounts, rates and 
						terms that can be offered. FICO scores range from 300-850. The higher your 
						score, the less risk involved in lending to you. There are approximately 30 
						factors that influence your credit rating. Some of these factors, such as your 
						payment history, weigh more heavily on eligibility than others. Every factor’s 
						importance varies by person and can change individually as your credit history 
						lengthens. Also, keep in mind your score can change daily as new credit is 
						established or debt is paid off. All factors can be grouped into 5 main 
						categories.
						<p><b>Payment History</b><BR>
						Do you make your payments on time? Since this determines approximately 35% of 
						your score, it is certainly in your best interest to make all payments on time! 
						Your payment history includes credit cards, car payments, mortgages, student 
						loans and other loan types. Other public records on file, such as a bankruptcy, 
						will be calculated in this group as well. If you have been late on payments, 
						information such as how recently these payments were made and how much time 
						elapsed between the due date and pay date will also factor into your score.
						<p><b>Outstanding Debt</b><BR>
						How much debt do you have? All outstanding balances for credit cards, car 
						loans, mortgages, etc. will determine about 30% of your score. How many of 
						these accounts have balances? For example, if you can possible pay down 
						significantly or pay off credit card debt, you’ll be in much better shape 
						during loan approval. Eliminating some avenues of credit can demonstrate your 
						willingness and ability to responsibly pay back new loans.
						<p><b>Credit History</b><BR>
						How long have you been establishing your credit? Specifically, how long have 
						your current accounts been opened and how long as it been since you used each 
						of them? This usually determines approximately 15% of your score. If no credit 
						history exists, you should begin by establishing credit accounts and be sure to 
						keep them spotless. The less history that exists, the less the loan amount 
						you’ll likely be able to obtain.
						<p><b>Pursuit of New Credit</b><BR>
						Each time you apply for credit, there is an inquiry into your current credit 
						score. If you recently applied for a VISA card, Nordstrom account and car loan, 
						you may want to hold off applying for a home loan for a few months. Each 
						inquiry may slightly reduce your FICO score and may portray you as someone 
						overindulging in credit. This usually accounts for approximately 10% of your 
						total score.
						<p><b>Types of Credit in Use</b><BR>
						The number of accounts (such as ATM cards, car loans, credit cards) you have 
						determines approximately 10% of your final score.
						<p>
						Once your bank is aware of your FICO score they may or may not choose to share 
						this information with you. Assuming they do share your score with you, it is 
						important to remember the higher the score, the more likely you are to obtain a 
						loan. Also, a higher score directly translates to lower interest rates. Over 
						time with home loans, lower interest rates can play a significant role in the 
						total amount you SAVE!
						<p><b><u>Other Factors That Determine Loan Approval</u></b>
						<p>
						Now, a great FICO score will not be the only determining factor in loan 
						approval. Some additional factors that figure into the approval process include 
						the following:
						<p><b>Income</b><BR>
						Your current income will be a significant determining factor in loan approval. 
						Pay stubs for the previous two months as well as W-2 forms for the previous 
						year will be requested to help determine your ability to repay the loan amount.
						<p><b>Employment History</b><BR>
						Your employment history can tell a lender much about your stability. If you’re 
						constantly switching jobs, it could raise a red flag.
						<p><b>Down Payment</b><BR>
						Being able to provide a down payment can be extremely useful in the loan 
						approval process. It means the amount borrowed will be less than the total cost 
						to purchase the home. In some cases, depending on the amount of the down 
						payment, your monthly payments can significantly drop.
