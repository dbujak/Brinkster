						Dear Buyer,
						<p>
						As you begin searching for the home you have been dreaming of, it is important 
						to think about the loan that will help you make this dream a reality. It is 
						important to get pre-approval from a bank before beginning the hunt for your 
						dream home. This will prevent your dream from turning into a nightmare. No one 
						wants to find the perfect home and then have their loan application denied. Not 
						only do pre-approvals help to determine the price range you can afford so that 
						you are not wasting your time looking for a home that is out of your price 
						range, but they also give you a bargaining tool when making an offer to the 
						seller.
						<p>
						When you are pre-approved for a mortgage, a lender has looked closely at your 
						credit report and income in order to determine that you qualify for a loan. The 
						lender will tell you which loans you qualify for, the maximum amount you are 
						eligible for and possible interest rates that are available to you. 
						Pre-approval letters are formal agreements between the buyer and lending 
						institution that offer a guarantee of loan approval for a specific amount. The 
						financial institution issuing such a letter may or may not charge for this 
						service. Keep in mind that even with a pre-approval letter, your bank may deny 
						the loan on the specific house you wish to purchase. As one example, banks will 
						deny the loan for a specific property if the appraisal is significantly less 
						than the sale price.
						<p>
						Pre-qualification letters are different from pre-approval letters in that they 
						do not include an analysis of your credit report or your true ability to 
						purchase a home. All it means is that someone has taken a general look at your 
						income and expenses in order to determine your debt-to-income ratio. This gives 
						you a general idea of the price range you can afford. There is no charge to 
						obtain pre-qualification letters.
						<p>
						Pre-qualification letters are a good idea to obtain so that you have an idea of 
						the price range to begin looking at. However, as soon as you are seriously 
						looking for a new home, it is important to get pre-approval. This will save you 
						time and give you more buying power.
						<P>I can be of service to you as we determine your price range and apply for 
							pre-approval. Please let me know if you have any questions.
						</P>
