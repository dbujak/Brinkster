						<h3>Saving for a Down Payment</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 150 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>
						<P>
						Dear Prospective Buyer,
						<p>
						Here are some tips on how to save for the down payment on your future home. I 
						hope this will help you to most effectively tap into your resources and budget 
						your finances. The more money you have saved for a down payment, the more 
						choices you will have when negotiating your mortgage. Let me know if I can be 
						of any assistance to you during the process of planning your down payment.
						<p><b>Keep Track of your Finances and Cut-back on Non-essential Spending</b><br>
						Write down your monthly income, savings, and spending. Even a couple bucks for 
						your daily Carmel Macchiato at Starbucks adds up. So instead of spending money 
						on the small stuff, put that into your savings. Open a savings account 
						specifically for the down payment. Calculate how much you can afford to 
						contribute to this account and arrange to make regular deposits.
						<p><b>Pay Off your Debt</b><br>
						Don't focus solely on saving for your down payment at the expense of paying 
						interest charges on credit cards. The interest rates on these loans are much 
						higher than the average rate for a home mortgage, meaning you are actually 
						wasting money by accumulating a larger down payment while carrying credit card 
						debt. Also, realize that the amount of debt you already have will determine how 
						much you can borrow for your home. After minimum payments, start with the card 
						with the highest interest rate and pay as much as you can. If you have more 
						than one card, repeat this process after you've eliminated the debt in the 
						first account. You'll be amazed how much money you can put into savings once it 
						is not paying for interest on credit card debt.
						<p><b>Make your Savings Work for You</b><br>
						Rather than saving all of the money yourself, let what you've already saved 
						earn you interest at the best rate possible. Often the best option is a 
						Certificate of Deposit. Although the earnings on CDs are lower than some other 
						types of investments, this is offset by a lower amount of risk. However, CDs 
						can carry very low rates of return when interest rates are low. In these times, 
						it is advisable to buy several certificates with different maturity dates. This 
						strategy is known as laddering; if interest rates rise, the short term 
						certificates can be reinvested at a higher rate. If rates should fall, then the 
						longer term CDs have locked in a higher rate of return.
						<p><b>Use Special Programs</b><br>
						There are many programs for home buyers in down-payment distress. Borrowers in 
						a wide range of incomes, locales and professional groups may have access to aid 
						from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored offices that buy 
						mortgages and package them as investments. Some lenders and government agencies 
						will let you buy a foreclosure with no down payment if you have good credit and 
						they are anxious to have the home occupied, or if you have skills that you can 
						use to increase the home's value. Various nonprofit and community groups also 
						lend a hand to buyers struggling to put money down on a home. And don't forget 
						about assistance from state agencies. To qualify for a down-payment assistance 
						program, the purchaser typically can earn no more than 80% of a region's median 
						income. Call your state housing finance authority, county housing and community 
						development office or mayor's office for an application.
						<p><b>Use IRA Funds</b><br>
						Tax laws allow you to use up to $10,000 in Individual Retirement Account funds 
						as a down payment if you have never owned a house. If you are married and you 
						both are first-time buyers, you each can pull from your retirement accounts, 
						meaning a potential $20,000 down payment. The IRS defines a first-time buyer as 
						one who did not own a principal residence at any time during the two years 
						prior to the purchase of the new home. If you are eligible, the IRS waves the 
						penalty fee for early withdrawal. Although, you are likely to owe state and 
						federal income tax on the amount withdrawn depending on the type of IRA you 
						have. If you do not qualify as a first-time buyer, early withdrawal will 
						include a 10 percent penalty as well as income tax.
						<p><b>Borrow from your 401(k)</b><br>
						Consider borrowing against your 401(k) for the down payment. Unlike an IRA 
						home-related withdrawal, you'll have to pay back any money you take out. Even 
						though your account contributions were made with pretax money, your repayment 
						will be made with after-tax dollars.
						<p><b>Make Money on Items Lying Around the House</b><br>
						One person's trash is another person's treasure. Go through your house and sell 
						unwanted items. Have a garage sale or post items on eBay. Perhaps you'll even 
						find a savings bond hiding in a drawer that is ready to be cashed in!
						<p><b>Receive a Gift</b><br>
						Tax law allows gifts of several thousand dollars a year to be bestowed without 
						tax consequences to either the giver or recipient, and it is not limited to 
						relatives. Check with the IRS to determine the gift-exclusion amount as it is 
						adjusted annually to reflect inflation. If no one is in a position to give you 
						the money, perhaps they will agree to co-sign a loan.
