						<h3>Improving a Credit Score</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 125 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>

						Dear Prospective Buyer,
						<p>
						As your real estate agent, my goal is not only to help you find your dream 
						home, but also to offer you tips to help you improve your credit score so that 
						you have the best options for financing your home purchase.
						<p>
						Lenders analyze your credit scores to determine whether or not to approve a 
						loan, including a home mortgage. Creditors are more likely to lend you the 
						money, if they feel like you will repay it in a timely manner. Credit scores 
						help lenders determine how much risk you are. The higher your score, the less 
						risk they think you will be. Your credit score is the three-digit number that 
						compares your credit performance to that of similar consumers. Scores range 
						from 300 to 850. I hope you can use the following tips to improve your score.
						<p><b>Check your own Credit Report</b><br>
						You are entitled to a copy of your credit report, including a list of everyone 
						who has requested your report within the past year. It is best to review your 
						reports from all three credit bureaus for accuracy once a year as well as 
						several months before applying for a loan. To obtain a copy of your report, 
						visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. It is important to 
						request reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion because each bureau may 
						have different information depending on which companies have reported to them 
						on your accounts. Mortgage lenders often look at all three of the bureaus' FICO 
						scores and take the middle score to assess your eligibility.
						<p><b>Correct Mistakes</b><br>
						Your credit score is only as good as what shows up in your credit report. If 
						there are any inaccuracies, it is important to dispute them by enclosing 
						supporting documents in a letter to the bureau.
						<p><b>Always Pay Bills on Time</b><br>
						It is imperative to avoid late and missed payments because your payment history 
						is the single biggest factor in a credit score, accounting for about 35% of the 
						score. Since recent history carries more weight than what happened years ago, 
						making on-time payments is a powerful way to rebuild your credit. If you know 
						you will be unable to pay bills on time, contact your creditors to work out a 
						payment arrangement and negotiate to keep the late notations off of your credit 
						reports.
						<p><b>Keep your Credit Card Balances Low</b><br>
						Pay off debt, don't move it around. Owing the same amounts, but having fewer 
						open accounts, can lower your score because lenders look at the total amount of 
						debt you have in comparison to the total amount of credit available to you. The 
						more debt you pay off, the wider that gap and the better your credit score. 
						It's ideal to keep your balances below 25% of your credit card limit. Another 
						way to keep a healthy balance-to-limit ratio is to charge less. Regardless if 
						you pay off your debt each month, credit scores do not distinguish between 
						those who carry a balance on their cards and those who do not.
						<p><b>Do Not Close Unused Accounts</b><br>
						A credit card with a zero balance might help your score. Closing credit 
						accounts lowers the total credit available to you, which would increase your 
						balance-to-limit ratio and, therefore, lower your credit score. Plus, closing 
						an account does not necessarily remove it from your report. Payment history may 
						still be considered for scoring purposes.
						<p><b>Do Not Apply to Open Multiple Accounts at Once</b><br>
						No matter how tempting those pre-approved credit card offers are, adding 
						accounts too rapidly sends up a red flag that you might not be able to handle 
						your credit responsibly. In addition, a new account will lower the average age 
						of your accounts, which is another factor in your FICO score.
