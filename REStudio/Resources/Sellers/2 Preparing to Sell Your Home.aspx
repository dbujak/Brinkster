						<h3>Preparing to Sell Your Home</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 150 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>
						<P>
						Dear Prospective Seller,
						<p>
						I've prepared some helpful tips for you (below) as you prepare to place your 
						house on the real estate market. If you have any questions, please don't 
						hesitate to contact me using the contact information at the bottom of this 
						email.
						<p><b>Disconnect Your Emotions </b>
						<p>
						When conversing with real estate agents, you will often find that when they 
						talk to you about buying real estate, they will refer to your purchase as a 
						"home." Yet if you are selling property, they will often refer to it as a 
						"house." There is a reason for this. Buying real estate is often an emotional 
						decision, but when selling real estate you need to remove emotion from the 
						equation.
						<p>
						You need to think of your house as a marketable commodity. Property. Real 
						estate. Your goal is to get others to see it as their potential home, not 
						yours. If you do not consciously make this decision, you can inadvertently 
						create a situation where it takes longer to sell your property.
						<p>
						The first step in getting your home ready to sell is to "de-personalize" it. 
						You should remove all photographs and other small items from table-tops. Buyers 
						should be allowed to imagine their personal possessions in the home, not look 
						at yours. You should also put away your personal collections so that buyers 
						don't get so interested in looking at them that they forget to look at the 
						house.
						<p><b>Create a Mood</b>
						<p>* Is there a mood that you could create? If you're near a coast, how about 
							breezy fabrics and blue-green colors that remind us of the beach? If you're in 
							the mountains, maybe you could go rustic. Study the house and brainstorm with 
							friends or family members to come up with ideas.<br>
							* Remove heavy drapes that keep out natural light, especially if there's a 
							great view out the windows.<br>
							* Bake bread during showings, or place a fresh loaf in a basket on the counter.<br>
						* Classical music playing softly in the background is nice, but choose 
						something that enhances the mood you are trying to create.
						<p><b>Make Sure It's Your House They Come Back to for a Second Look </b>
						<p>
						Here's a critical bit of home selling advice: don't even think of putting your 
						house on the market until you've taken a close look at its condition. You 
						usually only have one shot at impressing potential home buyers, so take some 
						time now to prepare the house for showings and you might be rewarded with a 
						faster sale and a higher offer. In order to do so though, you must trust your 
						instincts. Ask yourself what changes would make immediate improvements and what 
						features you want to show off the most. Evaluate your own home as if you were a 
						first time buyer.
						<p>
						You will find some other various home prep advice tips below.
						<p><b>Outdoor Tasks</b>
						<p>* Paint the front door and front entrance. The door is the face of the house and 
							one of the first things people notice. Make sure front entrance lights work.<br>
							* Keep the lawn and landscaping tidy, even if you have to hire someone to do 
							it.<br>
							* Store or organize items that make the yard look messy.<BR>
							* Outdoor lighting makes the home inviting in the evenings--when many buyers do 
							drive-bys of properties.<br>
							* Put potted flowers on the front steps. Water them and keep them healthy 
							looking.
							<br>
							* Fill and repair holes or cracks in the driveway or walkways.<br>
							* Sweep the driveway and pressure wash the house or sidewalks if necessary.<br>
							* Repair cracks in cement blocks. Likewise, a ten or twenty-dollar repair job 
							may be worth $3,000 in a buyer's eyes.<br>
							* Paint the shutters. Paint or touch up the trim.<br>
							* Clean the outdoor furniture. Paint the rust or toss it.<br>
							* Clean the drain gutters.<br>
							* Straighten gutters, planters, mailbox, or things that sag or tilt.<br>
						* Close the garage door. Hide the garbage cans. Put away toys. Remove extra 
						cars.
						<p><b>Indoor Tasks</b>
						<p>* Remove clutter from the kitchen. Keep the sink clean, free from dishes. Clean 
							the refrigerator and degrease the oven. Take drastic action to get a Spartan 
							look.
							<br>
							* Get rid of any odors. Get rid of ashtrays. Use an air freshener if the house 
							does not smell right. Eliminate the smell of dogs, cats, kids, spicy food, etc. 
							Odors are hard to explain away and are always noticed. If necessary, bake 
							cookies or an apple pie - - a good smell for the open house!<br>
							* Put away small kitchen appliances and other items that are sitting on 
							countertops and tables.<br>
							* Organize closets and cabinets so that they do not appear full and busting at 
							the seams.<br>
							* If the house is somewhat vacant, staging antiques appropriately can create a 
							dramatic emotional statement. There are professional companies that do just 
							that, usually for more expensive estates.<br>
							* Live plants look wonderful with nearly any decor.<br>
							* Get rid of any junk. If it has value, take it to a recycle establishment, 
							have a yard sale or donate it.
							<br>
							* Remove rugs if they hide nice hardwood floors.<br>
							* Are the walls in the house dingy? Are the colors dated? Paint them if 
							possible. Clean curtains and other window coverings. Clean dirt from overhead 
							fans.
							<br>
							* Tighten and repair loose knobs, sticky doors and windows.<br>
							* Replace burnt out bulbs. Repair light switches that do not work.
							<br>
							* Fix cabinet doors that do not work right. Oil hinges. Repair minor flaws.<br>
							* Repair caulking and grout in bathroom. Fix leaky faucets. Equip with fresh 
							soap and neat towels. Keep the bathroom spotless.<br>
							* Skylights should be crystal-clear.<br>
							* Replace faded wallpaper.<br>
							* Shampoo carpets, polish floors. Consider replacing carpet that is faded, 
							excessively worn or out of date.<br>
							* Repair cracks in the dry wall. A five-dollar repair job may keep a buyer from 
							raising an alert flag on a major repair and be worth $2,000 in the buyer's 
							eyes.
							<br>
							* Turn on the lights and open the curtains and let in the light. Obscure 
							unappealing views. Show all rooms bright. Increase the wattage if necessary. On 
							overcast days take special care to show it bright. Keep the room temperature 
							comfortable. Consider mirrors to make a dark room look larger as well as 
							reflect outdoor light.<br>
							* Take extra furniture out so that the room looks larger. That also goes for 
							pictures on the wall too.
							<br>
							* Vacant homes often blast home buyers with stale or mildew-laden air, and once 
							buyers smell mildew, they are out the door. During cold months, the interior of 
							a house without heat always feels colder than it is outside. Leaving the heat 
							or air conditioning running while a home is on the market reduces odors and 
							makes the house more inviting.
							<br>
						* Store boxes in an out of the way location or rent a temporary storage unit so 
						you can de-clutter every part of the house.
