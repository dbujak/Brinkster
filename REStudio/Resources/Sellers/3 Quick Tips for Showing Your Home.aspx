						<h3>Quick Tips for Showing Your Home</h3>

						Dear Prospective Seller,
						<p>
						As your local real estate agent, I've prepared some tips for you as your house 
						is shown to potential buyers.
						<p>
						Keep it clean. Even though you have thoroughly cleaned and prepped the home to 
						put it on the market, you must still live in it between showings. Be prepared 
						to tidy up and vacate your home at a moment's notice so it can be shown. Make 
						up beds first thing in the morning so that they are not forgotten. Keep 
						disposable floor wipes handy to be able to quickly mop floors as well as 
						freshen up bathrooms and kitchen sinks.
						<p>
						Open all window coverings to let in as much lights as possible. Turn on lights 
						in smaller rooms, such as bathrooms and the laundry room, to help them appear 
						larger. You want to create a lighted environment without overdoing it. If the 
						weather is nice, open a couple of windows to create a breeze and get some fresh 
						air into the house. If you have ceiling fans, turn them on to help circulate 
						air. In winter, think about turning the heat up slightly to make it cozy 
						feeling to potential buyers who walk in from the nippy outside.
						<p>
						You will also want to create a pleasant mood as the house is being shown. One 
						way to create this mood is to is to play soft music while the buyer is there. 
						You may also wish to place fresh flowers around the house to create a cheery 
						atmosphere. You may wish to create visual ambience by turning on key lights 
						such as chandeliers or scones.
						<p>
						Finally, make sure the home is vacant as it is being shown. You and your family 
						should take a walk or otherwise do something outside of the house. Make sure 
						the pets are gone too; put them in cages or take them to a neighbor.
						<p>
						Your goal is to make home buyers fall in love with the house as soon as they 
						see it from the street. And that comes with a bonus--a great overall impression 
						is often enough to make a buyer more lenient about minor repair issues. Every 
						house is different, and no one expects you to be a professional home stager. 
						but taking the time to prepare the house to the best of your ability can put 
						extra dollars in your pocket, and in less than average time.
						<p>
						If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to contact me. You'll 
						find that my expertise in this area is unmatched.
