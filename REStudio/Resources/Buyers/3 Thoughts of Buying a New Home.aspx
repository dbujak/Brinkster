						<h3>Thoughts of Buying a New Home</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 115 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>
						<P>
						Dear Potential Client,
						<p>
						Are you thinking of buying a home? Well, what are you waiting for? Let's work 
						together to start planning your future. I would like to help you do what I do 
						best -- find the perfect home for you. Here are a couple of questions you might 
						think about before we meet.
						<p>
						Are you ready to buy a home? Some factors to consider when preparing to buy a 
						home are whether or not you have a steady source of income and if you have been 
						employed on a regular basis for the last few years. Also, determine how much 
						money you have saved for a down payment and what would be a realistic amount of 
						money that you could spend on a mortgage each month. There are additional 
						expenses such as closing costs, taxes, insurance and home owners' association 
						fees that we should calculated as well. I can help you do this. Let's schedule 
						a meeting.
						<p>
						We should investigate the maximum loan amount that you would be able to afford 
						in order to establish the price range of houses to consider. Lenders calculate 
						your debt-to-income ratio, which is a comparison of your expenses to your gross 
						(pre-tax) income. Monthly mortgage payments should total no more than 29% of 
						your gross income, while the mortgage payment, combined with other long-term 
						debts (such as car payments) should not exceed 41% of your gross income. The 
						lender will also take into consideration your credit history and cash available 
						for a down payment when determining your maximum loan amount.
						<p>
						Once we have agreed on the price range of homes to look at, next we should 
						discuss your needs. Think about where you would like to live and how much space 
						you would like to have. I suggest driving through neighborhoods you are 
						considering and attend local open houses to get an idea of what you want. When 
						deciding on possible locations, think about distance to your job, schools, 
						family, etc. It's best to make a list of your priorities, such as location, 
						size, and amenities. Determine the minimum requirements that the house must 
						have for you to consider it as well as a wish list of perks you would like it 
						to have.
						<p>
						I am dedicated to meeting your needs and the more information you can share 
						with me, the better I can serve you.
						<P>
