						<h3>Deciding on a Neighborhood and Home</h3>
						<p><FONT size="2"><STRONG>(Reading time: 125 seconds)</STRONG></FONT>
						<P>
						Dear Prospective Buyer,
						<p>
						I would like to share some ideas with you about finding your future home, 
						including information on deciding on a community to live in and what to look 
						for during a walk-through.
						<p>
						When determining the neighborhood you would like to live in, please consider 
						its location approximate to your job as well as schools, public transportation, 
						shopping, museums, theaters and other attractions that might interest you. 
						Drive around the neighborhood and talk to residents. Can you picture yourself 
						happily living here? Most importantly, choose a community where you feel 
						comfortable.
						<p>Once you have narrowed your search to a particular area, contact the local 
							chamber of commerce for promotional literature about the community. I also 
							suggest visiting the local library as it is a wonderful source for information 
							on local events. I can give you information about the local schools <A href="/Brinkster/REStudio/Resources/Buyers/Schools.aspx">
								here</A>
						.
						<p>
						One of the questions I often get is whether or not it is best to buy a new 
						home. There are pros and cons to new homes as well as old. Newer homes are 
						usually easier to maintain and more energy efficient. Older homes generally 
						have lower property taxes and are in more established neighborhoods. On the 
						other hand, older homes are likely to require more repairs and upkeep.
						<p>
						It is best to evaluate each house based on what it has to offer. There are many 
						things to look for when walking through a home, including the following:
						<p>* Is the house structurally sound?<br>
							* Is the construction quality up to your standards?<br>
							* Is there enough space for the present and the future?<br>
							* Does it have the desired number of bedrooms and bathrooms?<br>
							* Are you happy with the lot size?<br>
							* Do you like the floor plan?<br>
							* Does it include all of the minimum amenities for your lifestyle?<br>
							* Will your furniture fit in the space?<br>
							* Is there enough storage space?<br>
						<p>
						I will help point out the pros and cons of each home from a professional 
						standpoint. Once we weed out the homes that do not interest you, we should 
						consider the details of the ones you like, including the amount of work that 
						needs to be done if you purchase the home. It is best to determine if all of 
						the mechanical systems and appliances work. Does anything need to be repaired 
						or replaced? Find out if the seller will do these things or offer an allowance 
						for the buyer to do them. If you are happy with the details, we should go back 
						to the final contestants for a second look. This will help us select the 
						perfect home for you. On average, homebuyers walk through fifteen houses before 
						selecting one.
						<p>
						The more you keep me updated with your needs, the better I can assist you!
