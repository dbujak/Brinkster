						<h3>Vacation Homes</h3>

						Dear Buyer,
						<p>
						Owning your own home is the American dream, but buying a vacation home is the 
						ultimate American fantasy. Whether it's a cabin in the mountains or beach 
						house, you will need to learn how to maximize the benefits of owning your 
						second home. For the majority of people, second homes can have many of the same 
						financial benefits as your first home. It is important to consult your tax 
						advisor so you understand the tax implications before you buy so you can make 
						the most of your second home investment.
						<p>
						Investing in a second home has several benefits. First, you get the same 
						financial rewards that come with homeownership; tax-deductible interest and 
						property taxes are most always deductible. In addition, you may be able to use 
						the home as a source of rental income. If you choose to rent out your vacation 
						home, it can help offset the costs of ownership. Second, you can deduct the 
						mortgage interest you pay on your second home. To the IRS, a second home is one 
						that you personally use at least 14 days per year, or at least one day for 
						every 10 days it’s rented out.
						<p>
						You can use the equity you have built up with your primary residence source to 
						help buy your vacation home. With home values in many markets much higher now 
						than they were a few years ago, many owners have experienced rapid equity 
						growth; leveraging that equity to invest in a second home may be a smart 
						financing strategy.
						<p>
						There are several things to consider when buying a second home. You need to 
						decide what you want to get out of your second home. If you are hoping to help 
						offset the cost of your second home by renting it put a portion of the time, 
						make sure you find out about rental demands in the area you are looking to 
						purchase. Do you want something close by so that you can go regularly, or do 
						you want something a little farther away for longer extended weekends? What do 
						you want to do when you get to your second home? Are you looking to be in the 
						hustle and bustle of the city, or do you want to enjoy the peace and quiet of a 
						secluded spot? The environment, location, and proximity you prefer are 
						important factors when looking for your second home.
