						Dear Buyer,
						<p>
						So you are considering buying rental property. You are now among the millions 
						of people each year who consider buying investment real estate. Owning rental 
						property can be very rewarding financially.
						<p>
						Becoming a successful rental property owner requires some work on your part. 
						While it is possible to sit back and collect income year after year without 
						doing any other work on your property, it is not a very realistic expectation 
						if you want to maintain a profitable investment for years to come. Before you 
						go out and purchase a rental property do some research so you understand what 
						to expect before you jump in and buy an income property. Your job is to rent 
						out your property, keep your tenants happy and maintain your property so it can 
						be easily rented out. This means you must fill your vacancies, respond to your 
						tenants needs, and take the time to make repairs that will last and even 
						increase your property’s value. Take some time to read articles on renting and 
						becoming a landlord before you move ahead and buy a rental property. Investment 
						real estate can be a worthwhile investment if you are well prepared to face any 
						challenges that may come along.
						<p>
						Investing in income property is riskier than buying a second home, because 
						rather than having a vacation home to go to relax and enjoy the weekend, an 
						income property is purchased to generate income. A duplex may sound easy to 
						rent and maintain. But if one unit is empty, 50% of your rental income isn't 
						coming in that month. Rental income is usually aimed at paying off a mortgage 
						used to purchase the income property. Valuing an income property is more 
						complex than valuing a residence. When you buy a residence, you are calculating 
						your ability to pay a mortgage out of your own earnings. When you buy an income 
						property, you're calculating how the income will help pay the mortgage.
						<p>
						Deciding where to buy a rental property, there are several things you should 
						consider. The supply of potential tenants, the average rents you can collect, 
						and the ability of tenants in that area to pay are all important factors that 
						you should research before your purchase. There are many advantages in 
						purchasing income property in college communities. There is always a need for 
						rental units and an endless supply of renters each year. Rental income tends to 
						be higher in college communities versus other areas and vaccines are limited. 
						When deciding whether to buy a single family home or multiple units, remember 
						that units tend to be far easier to rent out. Look for a property that can be 
						sold quickly. Look for properties with features that will attract renters such 
						as an apartment with a garage or private laundry facilities. If the property 
						you are interested in purchasing is currently being rented, ask about its 
						tenant’s rental history.
						<p>
						An income property has an annual net operating income. This is a figure of 
						rental income less anticipated vacancies, maintenance and other expenses. Most 
						investors divide the net operation income by something called the "cap rate" to 
						come up with the proper value for one apartment in a complex. The cap rate 
						relates to the expected annual rate of return on the property, and most income 
						property buyers recommend using a cap rate of 10% when evaluating a property. 
						This kind of simple calculation isn't perfect, but in a real-estate market that 
						is increasingly frantic, doing even simple math can help you understand if 
						you're overpaying for a property. Like investing in stocks, investing in real 
						estate works best when you don't overpay.
