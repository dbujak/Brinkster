							<h3>Kensington, MD - Custom Remodeling</h3>

									Click here for pictures</A></div>
							<p>This home was completely remodeled, with all the existing spaces brought down to 
								the studs, and a 3 story, 18 x 20 foot addition built. All new electrical, 
								hvac, and plumbing added. A new kitchen, family room, master bedroom, master 
								bath, and recreation room comprise the new space. The older spaces were 
								reconfigured to insure a better flowing floorplan, and include: a new dining 
								room, office, living room, sun-room, 4 bedrooms upstairs and 2 new baths. The 
								side and back patios offer the homeowners wonderful family and entertaining 
								areas with large flagstone patios and a 20 x 20 deck.
							</p>
							<p>Top of the line appliances were fitted in the kitchen. The whole house was wired 
								for audio, total of 8 zones, family room and home movie theater in the basement 
								for high definition TV and surround sound, also alarm and security cameras were 
								installed as well.

							<h3>Kensington, MD - Transformation of a Rambler / Front Porch charm</h3>
							<div id="clientsImgAlt"><A href="/Brinkster/RENOVATIONSTUDIO/Projects/ClientsImages/Homewood/default.htm" target="_blank"><IMG height="200" alt="Kensington, MD - Transformation of a Rambler / Front Porch charm"
										src="/Brinkster/RENOVATIONSTUDIO/Projects/ClientsImages/HomewoodBW.jpg" width="300" border="0"><br>
									Click here for pictures</A></div>
							<p>This small rambler went through an amazing transformation from being the most 
								modest house on its street to one of the most charming- and that was exactly 
								what the homeowners wanted. An exterior face-lift that would add curb appeal to 
								the home they loved.</p>
							<p>Located on a quiet cul-de-sac, with a creek separating the street, the only down 
								side of the lot was that that there was not much of a back yard at all. By 
								adding a front porch across the entire width of the house, the homeowners 
								gained an incredible new, outdoor living area. A beautiful walkway, laid with 
								river stones, leads to this impressive new structure. The most rewarding aspect 
								is that people have to wonder whether the porch was new, or had it always been 
								there? A nice testimony on our commitment to seamless designs.

							<p>An investor and admirer of Renovation Studio’s work, contracted with us to 
								oversee the design and finishes of this development project.
							</p>
							<P>Open, bright, inviting spaces flow beautifully into more distinct formal 
								entertaining rooms. The balance is perfect for today’s modern family. The 
								colonial was completely gutted, all new hvac, electrical, and pluming added. A 
								new family room/kitchen and breakfast nook were added to the back, and four 
								bedrooms, 3 ½ baths, and a beautiful master suite overlooking the treetops 
								resulted. The home sold in it’s first month on the market. Quite a commentary 
								as real estate sales began to struggle.

									Click here for pictures</A></div>
							<p>This project presented several unique and exciting challenges. The family hired 
								Renovation Studio in January of 2008 to reconfigure several spaces into three, 
								more distinct, larger spaces that would meet their family and entertaining 
								needs. The result was a new, much larger, state of the art kitchen, a separate 
								den and a new dining room. We completed the low voltage package, wiring for 
								surround sound throughout their new spaces, The entire project, start to 
								finish, included only 2 site visits from the owners. They had been posted 
								abroad for several years, and wanted to update their home prior to returning to 
								the United States with their family.
							</p>
							<P>They trusted us to oversee and manage the entire project via email, phone and 
								digital pictures. We used the latest technologies to effectively communicate 
								with the homeowners, update them regularly, and insure their wishes were being 
								met. We did so on a very tight schedule, just in time for their return to the 
								U.S. .

							<p>The homeowner purchased this beautiful water front property for the breathtaking 
								views. The house, while it’s space and flow were lovely, needed serious 
								updating.
							</p>
							<P>Renovation Studio reconfigured floor plans by removing walls, creating open 
								space and allowing light to flow freely through the entire first floor. The 
								kitchen was completely gutted and redesigned. Two bathrooms were completely 
								remodeled and upgraded. The floors were refinished, entire exterior and 
								interior painted. .
