						Renovation Studio is a Design/Build firm. We provide a process of developing 
						the best home renovation plan possible to satisfy the space 
						requirements/desires, lifestyle and budget needs of our clients. Our service 
						integrates design, realistic costing, construction and complete project 
						management. We also offer landscaping services on the property to complete the 
						overall exterior look of the home project.
						<p>
						Renovation Studio staff are very committed to maintaining very regular 
						communication with our clients during all phases of the project. We know that 
						the well coordinated time and effort spent on the planning phase of your 
						project is well worth it. Below is a snapshot of just how this process will 
						work.
						<p><STRONG>Introductions:</STRONG>
						The Renovation Studio staff will meet you at your home to review the space, 
						gather information about your goals, and review your budget for the project. If 
						our potential client feels comfortable and confident in our services, and 
						agrees to move forward, a Design Phase Agreement is presented.
						<p><STRONG>Design Presentation Phase:</STRONG>
						We measure and photograph your house and begin identifying, discussing, and 
						developing creative design solutions. Our architect will develop preliminary 
						drawings and elevations for presentation to the client for feedback.
						<p><STRONG>Contract for Construction:</STRONG>
						When the client finalizes their design drawings, we call in our subcontractors 
						and trade specialists to cost out the various phases of construction. With 
						project costs established, we can present you with a construction contract.
						<p><STRONG>Building Permits:</STRONG>
						We then secure all necessary permits for the job.
						<p><STRONG>Construction:</STRONG> Construction begins as scheduled. A site 
							supervisor will be managing the job from start to finish, insuring 
							subcontractor progress, delivery of quality work, and to bring the job in on 
							schedule.</p>
