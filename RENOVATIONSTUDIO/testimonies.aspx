<p>"We loved working with Renovation Studio!

<p>Jodi is a terrific project manager. She puts careful attention to the 
work plan, timeline and budget -- you know that you are working with a 
consummate professional who respects the resources and vision that you 
bring to the table!

<p>Her team is extraordinarily skilled, responsive and dedicated to their 
work and the final product. There were times when it felt like it was 
Joe’s house, when you saw the care and attention he paid to small 
details. What's wonderful to see is that they enjoy working with one 
another and the old fashioned pride in seeing a job well done is very 
much alive with this crew!

<p>This team is also around months after the job was done for questions, 
touchups and other house related questions. Long term service is a 
bonus!

<p>It was evident every step of the way that Renovation Studio was not only 
going to get the job done but ensure that the final product was a dream 
come true! We could not recommend them more.

<p>"I had a wonderful experience working with Renovation Studio and Jodi Longo. 
<p>Over the course of our construction, Jodi went out of her way to deliver everything she promised and more. 
I got to see Jodi perform all aspects of home 
design, construction, and project management. She did a masterful job! 
<p>We took a 1700 Sq Ft house that was built 
in 1928 and transformed it into a 3300 Sq Ft 2008 masterpiece. The house required all new electrical, plumbing, 
HVAC, drywall, flooring, bathrooms, kitchen, landscaping, and In-Home Audio/Video as well as a 1600 Sq Ft 
home addition. 
<p>Her work is meticulous and organized. We managed to pass every in-home inspection on the first pass, 
which is unheard of in home building. Once my house was finished I was still able to reach Jodi for help with 
anything I requested."</div>

<p>"Dear Jodi and the Renovation Studio crew,

<p>We can not express to you how proud we are of our new "old" house. 
You took a basic, brick colonial and worked your magic to turn it into
a stunning craftsman style home. We continue to have strangers stopping 
by to tell us we have their favorite house in Kensington, and everyone 
is especially envious of our spectacular front porch. Without 
hesitation, we tell them all about Jodi Longo and the Renovation Studio 
team. 

<p>The fabulous choices you made for the old and new interior rooms have 
also generated many lovely compliments. We take every opportunity to 
show off those inside spaces too. It was a pleasure to take your 
creation, decorate and make it our very comfortable home. We could not 
be happier.

<p>To anyone considering new construction or a renovation, I invite you to 
visit our gem of a house and let me tell you how delightful it is to 
work with Jodi and her totally professional, reliable, and talented 
team. 

<p>Thank you again for everything!

<p>"My family was very happy with the work Renovation Studio did to restore and renovate portions of our newly purchased 100 year-old home.  
<p>From the very beginning, we were taken with Jodi Longo's unwavering enthusiasm for the 
project.  Always positive, she saw the house for what it could be, not the 
daunting task other people seemed to perceive.  
<p>She was able to accomplish most of our top priorities while staying within our budget, and tenaciously worked to 
find solutions to the unanticipated issues that pop up in most renovations.  Our 
project manager, Joe, did outstanding work, and was very patient when, after the 
fact, I changed my mind several times.  The same goes for our lead painter 
David, who, among other things, waited for me to test 9 different paint colors 
on my front door before I was finally able to make a decision.  
<p>Overall, everyone we interacted with at Renovation Studio was hard working and friendly, 
and I have and will continue to recommend them to others.  On a final note, when 
our move-in date wound up being earlier than anticipated, Jodi and the crew put 
in major overtime and actually finished the project ahead of schedule! My family will always be grateful for that!"</div>
