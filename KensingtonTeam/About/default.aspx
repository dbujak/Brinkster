						The Kensington Team was created around the concept of "Keep It In Kensington". 
						We joined the local brokerage of Flaherty Group as a way to promote the idea 
						that clients expect and deserve a personal and detailed boutique experience 
						when it comes to real estate. Every client matters to us and receives exemplary 
						service from beginning to end. We have every confidence that we can give 
						clients what they need through out the process of buying and selling property. 
						We are experienced in finding the ideal home for clients as well as finding the 
						perfect property for investors.
						<p>Through our many years living in Kensington, we have developed many 
							relationships with tradespeople and companies that are based here. We hope to 
							provide people access to our vast lists of community resources that are 
							available to all of us here in lower Montgomery County. To find out more about 
							our community service resources, please open the "<a href="/Brinkster/KensingtonTeam/Resources/default.aspx">Resources</a>

										has had an exciting journey to reach his current home in historic Kensington 
										which he shares with his wife Jodi and their two young children. Born in 
										Yugoslavia, now Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dejan's first love was music but the 
										realities of a war torn nation interfered and he completed his education there 
										with the equivalent of an MS degree in the materials science. After the war 
										Dejan met and fell in love with a beautiful American working to establish voter 
										registration in Bosnia and married in 1998 moving back to Jodi's home in 
										Kensington. Dejan has a broad work background in internet communications, loan 
										origination/servicing and IT and earned his MS in Managing Information Systems 
										from GW University in 2005.
										<p>
										Dejan's love of and interest in real estate came naturally as a result of his 
										wife's company Renovation Studio. Jodi is a well know and respected local 
										builder/contractor and one of the rare women acting as principal in her own 
										firm. Jodi and Dejan purchased a number of properties beginning in 2006, 
										renovating and/or expanding them and then reselling them. Dejan's involvement 
										expanded to representing other clients in both the sale and purchase of 
										property and now has become the focus of his business career.
										<p>Dejan's experience in the communications field, his in depth of experience in 
											real estate as both an investor, first time homebuyer and new home construction 
											gives him a unique perspective in this complicated and difficult market. His 
											commitment to family and community, technological savvy and determination to 
											offer the highest in personal dedication to his clients and customers make 
											Dejan a "complete" professional.</p>
